IN NN NNS NN VBZ TO VBP , IN DT NN IN NNP IN DT:::About three months ago--that is to say, toward the end of May of this
NN IN CD NN NN WP$ NN VBZ IN DT NN VBD:::year of 1900--the writer whose name appears on the title-page received
IN JJ DT NN , CC NN IN NNS , IN PRP VBZ VBN PRP$ NN TO:::as noteworthy a letter, and packet of papers, as it has been his lot to
VB . PRP VBD IN DT RB JJ NN IN NN , WP$ NN EX VBZ:::examine. They came from a very good friend of mine, whose name there is
DT NN IN NN MD RB NN . NNP NNP NNP , NNP . DT .:::no reason that I should now conceal--Dr. Arthur Lister Browne, M.A.
( NN . ) , NN . NN . NN . NN . PRP VBD IN IN NN NNS NN VBD VBN VBG:::(Oxon.), F.R.C.P. It happened that for two years I had been spending
RBS IN PRP$ NN IN NNP , CC IN NNP VBD DT NNP NN , NN VBD:::most of my time in France, and as Browne had a Norfolk practice, I had
RB VBN PRP IN PRP$ NNS TO NNP . RB , IN PRP$ NN:::not seen him during my visits to London. Moreover, though our friendship
VBD IN DT RBS JJ NN , PRP VBD NN JJ NNS : RB:::was of the most intimate kind, we were both atrocious correspondents: so
IN RB NN NNS VBN IN PRP IN DT NNS .:::that only two notes passed between us during those years.
:::
IN , JJ NNP , EX VBN PRP DT NN DT NN WDT NN:::Till, last May, there reached me the letter--and the packet--to which I
VB . DT NN VBD IN NN NNS , RB VBN:::refer. The packet consisted of four note-books, quite crowded
IN IN DT JJ NNS IN NNP " PRP NN , WP$:::throughout with those giddy shapes of Pitman's shorthand, whose
NN RB VBZ VBN NNS VBG IN JJ VBZ IN DT:::_ensemble_ so resembles startled swarms hovering in flighty poses on the
VBG . PRP VBD VBD IN NN , IN JJ NN IN:::wing. They were scribbled in pencil, with little distinction between
JJ CC JJ NNS , JJ NNS : RB IN PRP$ JJ VBG , NN:::thick and thin strokes, few vowels: so that their slow deciphering, I
MD VB DT NN , VBZ VBN DT NN . DT NN RB VBD:::can assure the reader, has been no holiday. The letter also was
VBN IN NN ; CC DT NN , RB IN DT NN IN DT:::pencilled in shorthand; and this letter, together with the second of the
NNS WDT NN VBP VBD ( PRP VBD VBN " NN . " ) , NN RB:::note-books which I have deciphered (it was marked 'III.'), I now

NNS RB VBN IN PRP$ JJ NN ; CC IN NN NNS DT:::sentences rather crutched by my own guess-work; and in two instances the

:::
DT VBG VBZ NNP " PRP NN ::::The following is Browne's letter:
:::
" JJ JJ NN , NN VBP RB VBN VBG VBG IN PRP , CC VBG:::'DEAR OLD SHIEL,--I have just been lying thinking of you, and wishing
IN PRP VBD RB TO VB NN DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN:::that you were here to give one a last squeeze of the hand before
NN " NN " : IN , IN DT NN , " VBG " NN VBP . NN NNS RB , NN VBD:::I--"_go_": for, by all appearance, "going" I am. Four days ago, I began
TO VB DT NN IN DT NN , CC VBG IN JJ NNP " PRP NN:::to feel a soreness in the throat, and passing by old Johnson's surgery
IN NN , VBD IN CC VBD PRP TO VBP DT NN IN PRP . PRP VBD:::at Selbridge, went in and asked him to have a look at me. He muttered
VBG IN NNS NNS WDT VBN PRP NN , CC IN DT:::something about membranous laryngitis which made me smile, but by the
NN NN VBN NN NN VBD JJ , CC RB VBG : IN NN NN VBD:::time I reached home I was hoarse, and not smiling: before night I had
NN CC JJ NN . NN IN RB VBD TO NNP IN:::dyspnoca and laryngeal stridor. I at once telegraphed to London for
NNP , CC , IN PRP CC NNP , PRP VBP VBN VBG PRP$ NN ,:::Morgan, and, between him and Johnson, they have been opening my trachea,
CC VBG PRP$ IN IN JJ NN CC DT JJ NN . DT:::and burning my inside with chromic acid and the galvanic cautery. The
NN IN TO VBG VBZ VBD , CC PRP VBZ JJ WRB JJ:::difficulty as to breathing has subsided, and it is wonderful how little
NN VB : CC NN VBP JJ RB JJ DT NN RB TO VB WP " PRP WP : DT:::I suffer: but I am much too old a hand not to know what's what: the
NNS VBP NN NN NN IN DT NN IN JJ:::bronchi are involved--_too far_ involved--and as a matter of absolute
NN , EX NN " NN DT NN . NNP VBZ RB , NN VBP , RB VBG:::fact, there isn't any hope. Morgan is still, I believe, fondly dwelling
IN DT NN IN VBG PRP TO PRP$ NN:::upon the possibility of adding me to his successful-tracheotomy
NNS , CC NN VBD RB PRP$ JJ NN , CC NN VBP DT . DT:::statistics, but prognosis was always my strong point, and I say No. The
RB JJ NN IN PRP$ NN MD VB DT VBG IN DT NN:::very small consolation of my death will be the beating of a specialist
IN PRP$ JJ NN . RB PRP MD VB .:::in his own line. So we shall see.
:::
" NN VBP VBN VBG DT IN PRP$ NNS DT VBG , CC VBD:::'I have been arranging some of my affairs this morning, and remembered

" NN VBP IN DT JJ NN IN JJ , VBN IN IN DT JJ JJ:::'I am under a little morphia at present, propped up in a nice little

VB PRP IN DT JJ NNP " PRP VBG IN PRP$ . PRP$ NN VBD NNP NNP:::tell you in the old Pitman's something about her. Her name was Miss Mary

CC NN VBD PRP$ RB DT DT NN NNS . VBP PRP VB VBG:::and I knew her intimately all those fifteen years. Do you know anything
IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN . UH , IN VBD DT NN:::about the philosophy of the hypnotic trance? Well, that was the relation
IN NN CC NN . PRP VBD VBN IN DT NN IN:::between us--hypnotist and subject. She had been under another man before
PRP$ NN , CC DT NN VBD RB RB JJ IN PRP$ IN NN . PRP VBD:::my time, but no one was ever so successful with her as I. She suffered
IN NN NN IN DT JJ NN . PRP VBD VBD RBS IN PRP$ NNS:::from _tic douloureux_ of the fifth nerve. She had had most of her teeth
VBN IN NN VBD PRP$ , CC DT NN VBD VBN VBN TO VB IN DT:::drawn before I saw her, and an attempt had been made to wrench out the
NN IN DT VBN NN IN DT JJ NN . CC PRP VBN DT:::nerve on the left side by the external scission. But it made no
NN : DT DT NNS IN NN VBN IN IN JJ NN " PRP NN ,:::difference: all the clocks in hell tick-tacked in that poor woman's jaw,
CC PRP VBD DT NN IN NNP IN RB PRP VBD IN NN . PRP$:::and it was the mercy of Providence that ever she came across _me_. My
NN VBD VBD TO VBP RB JJ , CC RB JJ , NN:::organisation was found to have almost complete, and quite easy, control
IN PRP , CC IN DT JJ VBZ NN MD VB PRP$ NNP .:::over hers, and with a few passes I could expel her Legion.
:::
" UH , PRP RB VBD NN RB JJ IN JJ NN IN PRP$:::'Well, you never saw anyone so singular in personal appearance as my
NN , NNP NNP . NN IN NN VBP , NN MD RB VB PRP$:::friend, Miss Wilson. Medicine-man as I am, I could never behold her
RB IN DT NN IN NN : PRP VBD RB RB WP:::suddenly without a sensation of shock: she suggested so inevitably what
PRP VB " DT NN NN , " NN VBG IN PRP$ DT NN IN DT:::we call "the _other_ world," one detecting about her some odour of the
NN , IN DT VBG IN RB VBD RB NN IN NN . CC RB NN:::worm, with the feeling that here was rather ghost than woman. And yet I
MD RB VB TO PRP DT WRB IN DT , IN IN JJ NNS IN TO:::can hardly convey to you the why of this, except by dry details as to
DT NNS IN PRP$ JJ NN , NN NNS , VBD NN , CC JJ:::the contours of her lofty brow, meagre lips, pointed chin, and ashen
NNS . PRP VBD JJ CC RB VBN , PRP$ JJ NN ,:::cheeks. She was tall and deplorably emaciated, her whole skeleton,
IN DT NNS , VBG RB JJ . PRP$ NNS VBD IN DT JJ:::except the thigh-bones, being quite visible. Her eyes were of the bluish
NN IN NN NN , CC VBD IN PRP DT JJS , JJ , RB:::hue of cigarette smoke, and had in them the strangest, feeble, unearthly
NN ; IN IN NN PRP$ JJ NN IN NN VBD RB JJ .:::gaze; while at thirty-five her paltry wisp of hair was quite white.
:::
" PRP VBD JJ , CC VBD RB IN JJ VBG NN , NN:::'She was well-to-do, and lived alone in old Wooding Manor-house, five
NNS IN NNP NNP . IN PRP VB , NN VBD " VBG " IN DT NNS IN:::miles from Ash Thomas. As you know, I was "beginning" in these parts at
DT NN , CC RB VBD IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN . PRP VBD IN:::the time, and soon took up my residence at the manor. She insisted that
NN MD VB PRP TO PRP$ RB ; CC IN NN NN VBD:::I should devote myself to her alone; and that one patient constituted
DT RBS JJ NN WDT NN RB VBD .:::the most lucrative practice which I ever had.
:::
" UH , NN RB VBD IN , IN DT NN IN NN , NNP NNP:::'Well, I quickly found that, in the state of trance, Miss Wilson
VBD RB JJ NNS : JJ , NN VB , RB , IN NN ,:::possessed very remarkable powers: remarkable, I mean, not, of course,
IN JJ TO PRP IN NN , CC IN PRP VBD RB:::because peculiar to herself in _kind_, but because they were so
JJ , JJ , JJ , CC JJ , IN NN . DT NN:::constant, reliable, exact, and far-reaching, in degree. The veriest
VBG IN JJ NN MD RB VB CC NN RB TO:::fledgling in psychical science will now sit and discourse finically to
PRP IN DT VBG NNS IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN NN IN:::you about the reporting powers of the mind in its trance state--just as
IN PRP VBD VBG RB JJ ! DT JJ NN , NN VB PRP , WDT:::though it was something quite new! This simple fact, I assure you, which
DT JJ NNP NNP , RB IN JJ NN , VBZ:::the Psychical Research Society, only after endless investigation, admits
TO VB JJ , VBZ VBN RB RB VBN TO DT JJ NN IN:::to be scientific, has been perfectly well known to every old crone since
DT NNP NNPS , CC , NN VB , JJ RB . WP DT JJ NN:::the Middle Ages, and, I assume, long previously. What an unnecessary air
IN NN ! DT NN IN NN IN NN IN NNP MD:::of discovery! The certainty that someone in trance in Manchester can
VB PRP WP VBZ VBG IN IN NNP , CC IN NNP , VBD RB , IN NN ,:::tell you what is going on in London, or in Pekin, was not, of course,
VBN TO DT NN IN DT NN IN NNP NNP ; CC DT NN , IN:::left to the acumen of an office in Fleet Street; and the society, in
VBG DT NN IN NN IN DT JJ JJ , VBZ RB VBN:::establishing the fact beyond doubt for the general public, has not gone
NN NN IN VBG PRP . PRP VBP , IN NN , VBD VBG IN:::one step toward explaining it. They have, in fact, revealed nothing that
JJ IN PRP VBD RB , IN JJ NN , VB IN .:::many of us did not, with absolute assurance, know before.
:::
" CC VBG IN JJ NNP NNP , NN VBP IN PRP$ NNS VBD:::'But talking of poor Miss Wilson, I say that her powers were
NN , IN , IN RB JJ IN NN , PRP VBD RB:::_remarkable_, because, though not exceptional in _genre_, they were so
JJ IN NN , NN " JJ , " CC " JJ . " NN VBP PRP TO:::special in quantity,--so "constant," and "far-reaching." I believe it to
VB DT NN IN , NN NN , DT NNS IN NN JJ PRP:::be a fact that, _in general_, the powers of trance manifest themselves
JJR RB IN NN TO NN , IN JJ IN NN : DT:::more particularly with regard to space, as distinct from time: the
NN VBZ IN DT NN VBZ IN DT NN VBZ RB:::spirit roams in the present--it travels over a plain--it does not
NN VB DT NN IN NNS IN JJ NNS , CC IN:::_usually_ attract the interest of observers by great ascents, or by
JJ NNS . NN JJ IN VBZ RB . CC NNP NNP " PRP NN VBD JJ:::great descents. I fancy that is so. But Miss Wilson's gift was special
TO DT NN , IN PRP JJ IN DT NN , CC RB IN DT:::to this extent, that she travelled in every direction, and easily in all
CC NN , RB CC RB , IN CC RB , IN DT JJ , DT JJ , CC DT:::but one, north and south, up and down, in the past, the present, and the

:::
DT NN VBN , RB IN RB , CC RB . PRP MD VB DT NN:::This I discovered, not at once, but gradually. She would emit a stream
IN VBZ IN DT NN NN MD RB VB PRP NN , RB:::of sounds in the trance state--I can hardly call it _speech_, so
NNS , RB JJ , VBD DT NN , VBN IN JJ:::murmurous, yet guttural, was the utterance, mixed with puffy
NN IN DT JJ NNS . DT NN VBD VBN IN DT:::breath-sounds at the languid lips. This state was accompanied by an
JJ NN IN DT NNS , NN IN DT JJ ,:::intense contraction of the pupils, absence of the knee-jerk,
JJ NN , CC DT JJ CC NN NN . NN VBD IN DT:::considerable rigor, and a rapt and arrant expression. I got into the
NN IN VBG JJ NNS IN PRP$ NN , RB VBN IN PRP$ ,:::habit of sitting long hours at her bed-side, quite fascinated by her,
VBG TO VB DT NN IN IN NN CC JJ NN WDT:::trying to catch the import of that opiate and visionary language which
VBD VBG CC VBG IN JJ JJ IN PRP$ NNS .:::came puffing and fluttering in deliberate monotone from her lips.
RB , IN DT NN IN NNS , PRP$ NN VBD TO VB DT NNS ;:::Gradually, in the course of months, my ear learned to detect the words;
" DT NN VBD NN " IN PRP RB ; CC NN VBD JJ TO VB RB DT:::"the veil was rent" for me also; and I was able to follow somewhat the

:::
IN DT NN IN NN NNS NN VBN PRP$ NN NN VB DT NNS WDT:::At the end of six months I heard her one day repeat some words which
VBD JJ TO PRP . PRP VBD DT : " JJ VBD DT NNS IN WDT DT:::were familiar to me. They were these: "Such were the arts by which the

:::
NN MD VB PRP NN NNS : NN , IN IN NN PRP RB VBD IN:::I may tell you two things: first, that in trance she never spoke of

NN NN , IN " NN " : " PRP VBP , " PRP MD VB " PRP MD , " " PRP:::_objective_ way, as "_us_": "us are," she would say--"us will," "us

RB VBD IN DT NNP IN NNP , WRB PRP VBP " PRP " IN IN NN ;:::ever lived in the West of England, where they say "us" in that way;
RB , WRB VBG IN DT JJ , PRP RB VBN PRP IN:::secondly, when wandering in the past, she always represented herself as
VBG " NN " ( DT NN . ) , CC JJR DT JJ RB IN NN PRP:::being "_above_" (the earth?), and higher the further back in time she
VBD ; IN VBG JJ NNS PRP VBZ TO VBP VBD PRP NN:::went; in describing present events she appears to have felt herself _on_
( DT NN ) ; IN , IN VBZ DT NN , PRP RB VBD IN:::(the earth); while, as regards the future, she invariably declared that
" NN " VBD RB JJ NNS " IN " ( DT NN ) .:::"_us_" were so many miles "within" (the earth).
:::
TO PRP$ NNS IN DT JJ NN , RB , EX VBD TO VB:::To her excursions in this last direction, however, there seemed to exist
JJ VBN NNS : NN VBP VBD , IN NN MD VB JJ , CC RB VB:::certain fixed limits: I say seemed, for I cannot be sure, and only mean
IN , IN NN IN PRP$ NNS , PRP RB , IN NN , VBD RB IN DT:::that, in spite of my efforts, she never, in fact, went far in this

IN VBG PRP$ NN " IN " ; CC PRP$ NN " IN " RB VBD:::in describing her distance "above"; but her distance "within" never got
IN NN . RB , PRP MD VBP NN , NN . PRP:::beyond sixty-three. Usually, she would say twenty, twenty-five. She
VBD , IN NN TO DT NN , TO VB DT NN IN DT JJ:::appeared, in relation to the future, to resemble a diver in the deep
